🌌 DGM — The Dodecagram Instruction-Oriented Language

Tagline:
“Every Instruction Counts — Safe, Contextual, Base-12 Precision.”

📖 I. Introduction

DGM (Dodecagram Language) is a next-generation instruction-oriented programming language that unites human-readable clarity with machine-level precision.
It is designed from the ground up to:

Map every operation to a base-12 Dodecagram instruction space (144 slots).

Compile seamlessly to LLVM IR while embedding DGM opcode metadata annotations.

Provide healing arithmetic (safe by default, no undefined behavior).

Support structured data (tuples, lists, arrays, groups, nests) as native constructs.

Enable contextual inference macros (CIAM) for intelligent, self-resolving code expansion.

Guarantee interoperability with C/C++ while retaining a language identity of its own.

DGM is both a research vehicle in compiler design and a practical tool for industries where correctness, predictability, and safety matter above all.

🎯 II. Design Philosophy

Instruction-Oriented:

Every DGM source statement is an instruction, not a vague abstraction.

The compiler is transparent: .dgm → LLVM IR → Executable.

IR metadata tags (!dgm.opcode) ensure traceability from high-level code to low-level execution.

Safe by Default:

Overflow clamps instead of corrupting results.

Divide-by-zero returns a neutral safe value (0) instead of crashing.

branch.heal, recover, language.assert ensure programs continue running safely.

Structured Data First-Class:

Tuples, lists, groups, nests, pairs — not libraries, but core ops (tuple.pack, list.append, group.merge).

Mirrors the realities of data engineering, simulation, and complex algorithm design.

Contextual Intelligence (CIAM):

language.inline, language.expand, language.infer provide meta-instructions.

Programs can rewrite themselves contextually without external macros or preprocessors.

Universally Readable:

English-based keywords (safe.add, tuple.pack, language.parallel).

Chicago-style spacing & indentation rules for human readability.

Machine-friendly structure ensures predictability and clarity.

🔢 III. The 144-Entry Dodecagram

The DGM instruction set is bounded, enumerable, and complete:

00–4B (Core LLVM Ops) — standard computation, flow control, memory ops.

50–7B (Safe Arithmetic & Healing) — overflow-free arithmetic, healing branches.

80–9B (Data Structures) — tuples, lists, arrays, groups, pairs, nests.

A0–BB (CIAM & Intrinsics) — macros, inference, expansion, parallelism, sync.

This 12×12 grid (base-12 × base-12) guarantees no hidden instructions: the language space is closed, finite, and fully mapped.

🛠 IV. Compilation Pipeline
1. Lexer

Tokenizes source into identifiers, numbers, keywords, operators.

Recognizes instruction names (safe.add, tuple.pack, etc.) directly.

2. Parser

Builds an AST of numbers, strings, variables, binary ops, calls, and functions.

Rejects ambiguity — DGM syntax is strictly contextual.

3. AST

Simple, transparent node hierarchy.

dump() allows inspection of syntax tree.

4. Codegen

Lowers AST → LLVM IR with IRBuilder.

Attaches !dgm.opcode = "DGM:XX" metadata to every instruction.

Falls back to external function declarations for unresolved calls.

5. Runtime

Implements dgm_safe_add, dgm_list_append, dgm_tuple_pack, dgm_parallel_begin, etc.

Written in portable C, linked automatically.

Guarantees safe arithmetic and deterministic structured ops.

6. Driver (dgmc)

Command-line compiler.

Options:

--emit-llvm → annotated .ll output.

--run → compile + execute.

-o file → specify output binary.

Links runtime automatically.

🧪 V. Current Capabilities

Arithmetic: Safe integer operations with clamping and divide-by-zero healing.

Functions: Define and call with func ... start ... end.

Calls: Interop with C runtime (print, etc.).

Data Structures: Tuples, lists.

Parallelism: language.parallel / language.sync primitives.

LLVM IR Output: Fully annotated with base-12 opcode mapping.

Executables: Portable binaries across Linux/macOS/Windows.

🌟 VI. Use Cases

Safety-Critical Systems

Aerospace flight software.

Medical device control loops.

Autonomous navigation.

Financial Systems

Overflow-proof transaction calculations.

Deterministic reproducibility for audits.

🏆 VII. Where DGM Outshines

vs C/C++: No undefined behavior. Safety built-in.

vs Python: Strong typing, LLVM-native performance.

vs Rust: Easier readability, explicit instruction mapping.

vs LLVM IR: Human-readable, but still machine-precise.

⚡ VIII. Performance

Startup speed: near-instant (compiled binaries).

Execution speed: LLVM-optimized machine code (on par with C).

Runtime footprint: minimal, only helpers for safety/data ops.

Parallelism: efficient once full threading primitives replace mock runtime.

🔐 IX. Security & Safety

Arithmetic safety: clamps overflow, heals division.

Memory safety: virtual registers abstract stack/heap.

Concurrency safety: explicit parallel/sync with safe defaults.

Predictability: no hidden instructions, no surprises.

🌍 X. Interoperability

FFI/ABI compatibility with C/C++.

LLVM backend ensures cross-language linkage (Rust, Swift, etc.).

Direct transpilation to C++11 if needed.

Inline calls to system libraries through LLVM externs.

🕰 XI. Future Directions

CIAM Expansion: true contextual inference macros (language.infer, language.trace).

Data Structures: full arrays, groups, nests, match/case pattern matching.

Runtime Expansion: better parallelism with threads/fibers.

Package Ecosystem: dgm-pkg manager for libraries.

Interactive REPL: JIT-backed execution for prototyping.

Formal Verification: integrate SMT-based proofs into safe arithmetic layer.

Education Tooling: visualization of lexer → parser → AST → IR pipelines.

🧭 XII. Why DGM?

Instruction-oriented clarity: 144-op bounded set.

Human readability: English keywords.

Machine precision: LLVM IR metadata.

Safety built-in: healing arithmetic, predictable flow.

Interoperability: C/C++ FFI, LLVM toolchain.

Innovation: CIAM macros for contextual self-expansion.

🌌 XIII. Why It Was Created

To prove that instruction-oriented languages can be safe, human-readable, and machine-perfect.

To bridge the gap between theory (compilers) and practice (applications).

To create a bounded, enumerable instruction space (144 Dodecagram ops) where nothing is hidden.

To explore new paradigms in safe arithmetic, contextual macros, and annotated IR.

✅ Final Word

DGM is a new kind of language:

Not object-oriented, not functional, not purely imperative.

Instruction-Oriented.
Every line you write is an instruction. Every instruction is mapped. Every mapping is annotated.
It is predictable, safe, interoperable, and ready — today.

DGM shines where safety, clarity, and traceability matter most.
It is a language for the future of system safety, education, and human-readable machine programming.

Embedded firmware that demands lightweight, safe execution with deterministic output.

📚 Learning Curve

Lower than C/C++: English-style keywords (safe.add, tuple.pack) are intuitive.

Slightly higher than Python: instruction orientation means users must think in terms of ops, not just high-level abstractions.

Similar to Rust in discipline: safety is built in, but without as much syntax ceremony.

🔗 Interoperability

Direct FFI with C/C++: via LLVM + runtime linkage.

Inline C++ transpilation: DGM → LLVM → native OR DGM → C++11 source.

Interop with Python/Java/Rust: possible through LLVM IR libraries.

ISA friendliness: base-12 annotations survive into .ll metadata, aiding cross-language debugging.

🎯 Purposes and Use Cases

Core purpose: create a safe, instruction-oriented language that bridges human readability with machine precision.

Use cases:

Prevent overflows/divide-by-zero at runtime.

Track every instruction via DGM metadata.

Provide deterministic, minimal runtime.

Enable structured data ops (tuples/lists/groups) natively.

Allow contextual macro inference (CIAM) for dynamic code expansion.

⚡ What Can DGM Do Now?

Compile .dgm → LLVM IR → Executable.

Annotate LLVM IR with base-12 DGM opcodes.

Run safe arithmetic, tuples, lists, and parallel constructs via runtime.

Inline call to C functions (print, etc.).

Generate portable executables (.exe, .out) via LLVM backend.

🌟 Where DGM Shines

When safety matters more than speed (but without losing LLVM optimizations).

When predictability and reproducibility are critical (scientific, financial, aerospace).

When debugging instruction pipelines (because annotations show you exactly which DGM op emitted which IR).

When teaching compiler design (clear 144-op mapping, LLVM hooks).

🏆 Where DGM Out-Performs Others

Safer than C/C++: no undefined arithmetic overflow.

More deterministic than Python/JS: strongly typed, IR-mapped.

More transparent than Rust: annotations + healing arithmetic visible in IR.

More approachable than LLVM IR: English-like keywords, structured data.

🚀 Potential and Next Steps

Potential: become the go-to instruction-oriented, safe arithmetic language for education, aerospace, and finance.

Next steps:

Expand runtime (arrays, groups, nests fully).

Optimize parallelism beyond placeholders.

Add CIAM (Contextual Inference Macros) for real contextual transformations.

Build package manager (dgm-pkg).

Add REPL / JIT mode.

🌍 Where DGM Is Most Needed

Systems where crashes are unacceptable (medical, defense, banking).

Learning environments (universities teaching compiler construction).

High-reliability data pipelines (scientific research, simulations).

⚡ Performance

Startup speed: near-instant (LLVM AOT compiler, no heavy runtime).

Execution speed: LLVM-optimized native code (comparable to C).

Load time: just as fast as compiled C/C++, since binaries are machine code.

🔐 Security and Safety

Memory safety: virtual registers + invisible stack/heap.

Arithmetic safety: healing ops (no UB on overflow/division).

Concurrency safety: parallel/sync primitives use controlled sync.

Interop safety: ABI-level compatibility with C/C++.

🤔 Why Choose DGM?

When you want a language that’s:

Predictable (every instruction mapped).

Safe (errors heal, don’t crash).

Readable (English-leaning keywords).

Portable (LLVM backend, cross-platform).

Interoperable (drop into C/C++ when needed).

🛠 Why DGM Was Created

To fill the gap between low-level precision (LLVM IR) and high-level clarity (English-style syntax).

To eliminate runtime surprises (arithmetic overflow, divide-by-zero, unsafe concurrency).

To prove a concept: an instruction-oriented language can be both human-readable and machine-perfect.

To experiment with base-12 instruction mapping for symbolic, deterministic debugging.

✅ In short:
DGM is for people who need instruction-level clarity, arithmetic safety, structured data, and LLVM-backed performance — without sacrificing readability or predictability.

 _____

🧭 Orientation of DGM

Paradigm: Instruction-Oriented (IOP)
Every construct maps deterministically to a DGM opcode, which in turn maps either directly to LLVM IR or to a CIAM-layered expansion. Unlike object-oriented or purely functional systems, the heart of DGM is the instruction dispatch table — a 1:1 link between the Dodecagram (base-12) index and executable semantics.

Execution Model:

AOT (Ahead-of-Time): All .dgm programs are compiled to LLVM IR, then to native binaries (.exe, .out, etc.).

Optional JIT: Used only for hot swaps, mutations, and CIAM-driven macro inferences.

Virtual Register Memory: Stack and heap are abstracted away; values live in a virtual register file, and the compiler invisibly maps this down to LLVM registers + memory slots.

Safety Layer (50–7B): Adds healing constructs (safe.add, branch.heal, recover) so arithmetic and flow errors never crash execution. These resolve at compile-time when possible, or transparently at runtime.

Data Layer (80–9B): Rich first-class collections (tuples, lists, arrays, groups, nests, pairs) map directly to runtime helpers, but still lower into efficient IR.

CIAM Layer (A0–BB): The “Contextual Inference Abstraction Macro” region is unique to DGM. It encodes higher-order operations — macro expansion, inference, trace, echo, parallel/sync — that get resolved before lowering to LLVM IR. Think of it as the meta-brain of the language.

📚 Why This Mapping Matters

Base-12 Instruction Space:

DGM uses 12×12 grid (144 slots) — perfectly aligned with dodecagram symbolic logic.

This guarantees a bounded, enumerable, and complete ISA, which makes it predictable and instruction-oriented.

LLVM Integration:

Core ops (00–4B) are just LLVM instructions under another name → zero impedance mismatch.

Safe ops, Data ops, and CIAM ops are layered on top of LLVM with runtime + pass annotations.

Error Handling Philosophy:

Instead of raising runtime errors, DGM either auto-heals or redirects flow.

This is why you have branch.heal, recover, and language.assert instead of LLVM’s exceptions.

Readable Yet Machine-Friendly Syntax:

English-leaning keywords (tuple.pack, language.inline)

MLA/Chicago style spacing & indentation rules → designed for structured readability.

CIAM guarantees contextual inference: code never gets ambiguous.

4. **LLVM & Clang** ≥ 12.0 installed + `llvm-config` in PATH.
5. **Pthreads** (default on Linux/macOS, install separately on Windows).
6. **Clone repo**, configure with CMake, build with `make`.
7. Use `dgmc` to compile/run `.dgm` → `.exe`.

---

This way, anyone can set up **DGM** from scratch, even if they’ve never built a compiler before.

# 🛠️ DGM Language — Step-by-Step Installation Guide

---

## 🐧 Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based)

1. **Update packages**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake clang llvm-dev lld
```

3. **Verify LLVM installation**

```bash
llvm-config --version
```

Should show `>= 12.0`.

4. **Clone DGM**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/dgm-lang.git
cd dgm-lang
```

5. **Build DGM**

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

6. **Test hello program**

```bash
./dgmc ../examples/hello.dgm -o hello --run
```

✅ Output:

```
Hello, DGM World!
```

---

## 🍎 macOS (Homebrew)

1. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. **Install LLVM + CMake**

```bash
brew install llvm cmake
```

3. **Add LLVM to PATH**

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

4. **Verify LLVM**

```bash
llvm-config --version
```

5. **Clone & Build DGM**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/dgm-lang.git
cd dgm-lang
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DLLVM_DIR=$(brew --prefix llvm)/lib/cmake/llvm ..
make -j4
```

6. **Run Example**

```bash
./dgmc ../examples/safe_add.dgm -o safe_add --run
```

✅ Output:

```
30
```

---

## 🪟 Windows (MSVC or MinGW)

### Option A: MSVC (Visual Studio)

1. **Install Visual Studio 2019 or newer**

   * Include **Desktop development with C++**.

2. **Install LLVM/Clang for Windows**
   Download from [https://releases.llvm.org](https://releases.llvm.org).
   Add LLVM `bin/` folder to `PATH`.

3. **Install CMake**
   Download from [https://cmake.org/download](https://cmake.org/download) or use `winget`:

   ```powershell
   winget install Kitware.CMake
   ```

4. **Clone Repo**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/yourname/dgm-lang.git
cd dgm-lang
```

5. **Build with CMake (MSVC Generator)**

```powershell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

6. **Run Example**

```powershell
.\Release\dgmc.exe ..\examples\hello.dgm -o hello --run
```

---

### Option B: MinGW (Lightweight)

1. **Install MSYS2**
   Download from [https://www.msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org).

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain cmake llvm
```

3. **Build DGM**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/dgm-lang.git
cd dgm-lang
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
mingw32-make -j4
```

4. **Run Example**

```bash
dgmc.exe ../examples/tuple_test.dgm -o tuple_test --run
```

---

## 🧪 Testing All Examples

Once installed, run the bundled test script:

```bash
./tests/run_examples.sh
```

Expected output will cycle through all example programs (`hello`, `safe_add`, `tuple_test`, `list_test`, `parallel`).

---

# ✅ Installation Recap

1. Install **C++11 compiler**, **CMake**, and **LLVM (≥ 12.0)**.
2. Clone the `dgm-lang` repo.
3. Run `cmake .. && make` (or MSVC/MinGW equivalent).
4. Compile `.dgm` files with `dgmc`.
5. Run programs directly with `--run`.

# 📦 `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# -------------------------------
# DGM Language — Docker Container
# -------------------------------

# Use LLVM-ready base image
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Set environment variables
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
ENV LLVM_VERSION=14

# Install build essentials + LLVM + CMake + Git
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    git \
    clang \
    llvm-$LLVM_VERSION \
    llvm-$LLVM_VERSION-dev \
    lld \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Add LLVM to PATH
ENV PATH="/usr/lib/llvm-${LLVM_VERSION}/bin:${PATH}"

# Create workspace
WORKDIR /opt/dgm

# Clone repo
RUN git clone https://github.com/yourname/dgm-lang.git . 

# Build
RUN mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j4

# Default command: run hello example
CMD ["./build/dgmc", "examples/hello.dgm", "-o", "hello", "--run"]
```

---

# 🛠 Build & Run Instructions

### 1. Build the image

```bash
docker build -t dgm-lang .
```

### 2. Run inside container

```bash
docker run --rm dgm-lang
```

✅ This will compile and run `examples/hello.dgm` automatically.
Output:

```
Hello, DGM World!
```

### 3. Interactive container

If you want a shell inside:

```bash
docker run -it --rm dgm-lang /bin/bash
```

---

# 🧪 Mounting Local `.dgm` Files

To compile your own programs without rebuilding the image, mount your source folder:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace dgm-lang /bin/bash
```

Inside container:

```bash
cd /opt/dgm/build
./dgmc /workspace/my_program.dgm -o my_program --run
```

---

# ✅ Why Use Docker?

* No need to install LLVM/CMake on host.
* Consistent environment across Linux/macOS/Windows.
* Perfect for CI/CD pipelines.
* One command (`docker run`) → instant compiler.
